All Ian Macleod Distillers employees who have access to your personal data are required to adhere to the Ian Macleod Distillers Privacy Notice and all third-party service providers are requested by Ian Macleod Distillers to ensure that any of their employees who have access to your personal data have signed non-disclosure agreements.

3. HOW IAN MACLEOD DISTILLERS USES YOUR PERSONAL DATA
Your personal data will only be used for the purposes for which you provided it to Ian Macleod Distillers, as indicated to you at the time you provided your personal data. It will also be used to administer, support and obtain feedback on the level of our services, to help prevent breaches of security, the law or our contract terms, and for direct marketing purposes.

4. WHO IAN MACLEOD DISTILLERS DISCLOSES YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO AND WHY
Ian Macleod Distillers will never share your personal data with any Third-Party business organisation that intends to use it for their own purposes, other than as required by law. Ian Macleod Distillers, as part of Ian Macleod Distillers group, may transfer or disclose your personal data to another data controller in the Ian Macleod Distillers Group to be used for similar purposes, at its discretion, and you hereby consent to such transfer or disclosure. If your personal data is transferred or disclosed to another data controller within the Ian Macleod Distillers Group, that other data controller shall have the same rights and obligations with regard to your personal data as Ian Macleod Distillers.

With your consent, Ian Macleod Distillers may share your personal data with Third-Parties such as those who assist us in providing the products and services and who perform technical operations, but only in the strictly limited circumstances set out below:

Our “Third-Party Data Processors” (service providers such as our fulfilment and activation partners, and digital agencies, hosting providers, data storage providers and other technical partners) who help us administer this website, or process the data submitted to it, may have access to your data. Some of these business partners may be located outside the country where you accessed this website.

5. YOUR RIGHTS
You have the right to ask Ian Macleod Distillers to provide you with all the information it stores on you. You have the right to ask Ian Macleod Distillers to rectify, block, complete and delete your personal data, to restrict its use, and to port your data to another organization. You have the right to request additional information about the handling of your personal data. You also have the right to object to the processing of your data by Ian Macleod Distillers in some circumstances and, where we have asked for consent to process your data, to withdraw this consent. Additionally, you may contact our Data Protection Officer at DataPrivacyOfficer@IanMacleodDistillers.com if you would like assistance with any of the aforementioned rights.

There are exceptions to these rights, however. For example, access to personal data may be denied in some circumstances if making the information available would reveal personal information about another person or if Ian Macleod Distillers is legally prevented from disclosing such information. In addition, Ian Macleod Distillers may be able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent, where Ian Macleod Distillers can demonstrate that it has a legal requirement to process your data.
